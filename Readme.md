# Cryptography Research Paper Reading Group

Welcome to the **Cryptography Research Paper Reading Group**! This is our hub for weekly paper discussions, insights, and system implementations.

## Group Overview
- **Goal**: Explore cryptography research by reading and discussing one paper weekly.
- **Meetings**: Weekly sessions to summarize, discuss, and collaborate on implementations.
- **Implementation**: Develop systems inspired by the papers we read.

## How It Works
1. **Paper Selection**: Suggest and select papers via GitHub issues.
2. **Read & Discuss**: Read the paper and join the weekly meeting.
3. **Collaborate**: Implement and experiment with ideas inspired by the paper.

## Getting Started
1. **Join**: Add yourself to the [Participants List](participants.md) via pull request.
2. **Engage**: Watch the repo for updates, participate in discussions, and contribute ideas.
3. **Collaborate**: Work on implementations in the `implementations/` folder.
